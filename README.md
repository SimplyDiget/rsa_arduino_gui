- Computer with Qt5 installed

### Software Requirements
1. Install the Arduino IDE.
2. Install Qt5 on your computer.

## Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
- **/Arduino**: Contains the Arduino code for RSA encryption.
- **/Qt5_GUI**: Includes the Python code for the graphical user interface using Qt5.

## How to Use
1. Upload the Arduino code to your Arduino Uno board.
2. Run the Python script in the Qt5_GUI folder to open the graphical user interface.
3. Follow the instructions on the interface to encrypt and decrypt messages using RSA.
